## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

We're using this document as the basis for an experiment. The question is -- can non-technical folk effectively collaborate on RMarkdown documents? The topic of this document is Uber. It's on a public Github repo, so only public information and opinions you want to openly share should be included.
